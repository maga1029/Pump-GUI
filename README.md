This GUI is made for the creation of a pumping schedule, which you need to know before inputing the values. You need to input how many pumps will be there, if a pump is for a service or an afluent (irrelevant), the name of the substance or pump (optional), how many times will the pump operate, and the time of operation each time a pump is used (you can adjust the flow of each pump and substance). A table will be displayed showing if you're satisfied with the schedule. You can return at any time. Afterwards, you just click enter. You have to add the pump-operating pump before time.
